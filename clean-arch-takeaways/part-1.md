# Part 1

## Goal of Software Architecture

p5 _"The goal of software architecture is to minimize the human resources required to build and maintain the required system."_

## A Tale of Two Values

p14 _"Every software system provides two different values to the stakeholders: behavior and structure. Software developers are responsible for ensuring that both those values remain high."_

p14 _"Software was invented to be "soft". It was intended to be a way to easily change behavior of machines. If we'd wanted the behavior of machines to be hard to change, we would have called it hardware."_

p14,15 _"The difficulty in making such a change should be proportional only to the scope of the change, and not to the shape of the change."_

p17 - _"The dilemma for software developers is that business managers are not equipped to evaluate the importance of architecture. That's what software developers were hired to do. Therefore it is the responsibility of the software development team to assert the importance of architecture over the urgency of features."_
